            Our life seems to be full of complexities. At times we laugh, at other times we shed tears. Once in a while we just stare at each other and, yeah, also fight. Nonetheless, despite all of our apparently inconsistent ideas, we manage to move forward and survive together. We might have caused each other pain that might not even fade with any word of apology. Nevertheless, I am confident that everything that we've gone through is merely part of a strong structure that heaven is building for us. I love you so much! To say this a million times is not enough to express how much I really do. I love you dearly and still will beyond the stars.
